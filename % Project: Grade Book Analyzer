% Project: Grade Book Analyzer

% Step 1: Create a 4x3 matrix of grades (4 students, 3 tests)
grades = [85 90 78; ... % Student 1
          92 88 95; ... % Student 2
          75 80 82; ... % Student 3
          60 65 70];   % Student 4

% Step 2: Calculate average score for each student
student_averages = mean(grades, 2); % Mean along columns (dimension 2)

% Step 3: Find highest score for each test
test_max = max(grades, [], 1); % Max along rows (dimension 1)

% Step 4: Use logical indexing to find high scores (>80)
high_scores = grades > 80; % Logical matrix: 1 where score > 80
num_high_scores = sum(high_scores, 'all'); % Count total high scores
high_score_values = grades(high_scores); % Extract high scores

% Step 5: Visualize student averages with a bar plot
figure;
bar(student_averages, 'FaceColor', 'cyan');
title('Average Grades per Student');
xlabel('Student');
ylabel('Average Score');
grid on;

% Step 6: Display results
disp('Grade Book:');
disp(grades);
disp('Average Score per Student:');
for i = 1:4
    fprintf('Student %d: %.2f\n', i, student_averages(i));
end
disp('Highest Score per Test:');
for i = 1:3
    fprintf('Test %d: %d\n', i, test_max(i));
end
fprintf('Number of Scores > 80: %d\n', num_high_scores);
disp('High Scores:');
disp(high_score_values');
